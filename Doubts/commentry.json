We've been trying to get Pretorius in but the combinations were really tough, so today he came in place of Lungi and did a very, very good job. We didn't start well once again. The nature of the wicket told me that we needed to bowl straight lines, a consistent top-of-off lines. It looked like the kind of wicket that would be tough with consistent lines and length and that is why I brought Andile on early. It feels bitter-sweet, it doesn't feel like it means that much. It's a little bit too late. The basics of batting were shown today. We've batted well all through the tournament, but we just didn't have guys batting through. Hashim gave us a good foundation, one big partnership makes it look so much easier. We hadn't done that consistently in the tournament. I think Bangladesh was the one that really took the wind out of our sails. England are a very good team and they were too good for us on that day. Bangladesh played an unbelievably good game and that sucker punched us and we almost took the hangover of that game into the next game.

Unfortunately, we had only 200 on the board and the wicket was getting better and better after which they batted really well. I felt the wicket was a bit slow, they bowled really well and their fielders in the ring kept the pressure on. They planned really well. We couldn't get the singles and kept looking for big shots. We needed to get early wickets. Malinga started really well, but we couldn't build any pressure from the other end and nobody could get wickets. We have to learn how to build pressure on the batsmen in these kind of tournaments. We need to learn how to get batsmen to make mistakes.
